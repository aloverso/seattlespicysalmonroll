The Bladegod smiles upon those who choose to follow the path of the wheeled ones. Through our trials and tribulations of last week, we are gifted with wonderful weather and views in which to enjoy the fruits of toil.

This week we will follow the Bladegod's command to Golden Gardens via the bike gilman to bathe in the setting sun which he (The Bladegod) hath bestowed upon us. This Skate is very beginner friendly and we welcome all ages and skill levels. It will be ~15 miles going to Golden Gardens and back with the route being very flat.

We meet above Triangle Garage at 6pm, rollout at 6:30pm along the Bike Gilman, bikini's and beach balls optional. (Traffic and parking is awful around U-District please plan accordingly).

You can park near Dunn Lumber or Gasworks for example.

Looking forward to seeing you all out enjoying the weather brought to us.

By dear Cameron Shore , the one blessed by Bladegod
