Welcome, bladies and skatemen, to our Saturday Skate!

This time we will have a two part route, where the first 7 miles is a loop - we will return to Gasworks Park after we go around Greenlake. We will follow the Bunny totem, welcoming all skill levels on this part of the skate - it will be newbie friendly with not a lot of elevation, and a nice warm up for the advanced team.

The second part of the route is pure urban skating at the pace of Mammoth - minimum resting stops, average skating speed of 10+ mph, hills and traffic, more miles. For this part all intermediate/advanced skaters are warmly welcomed!

For the Bunny part you can use any type of skates or transportation devices.

For the mammoth skate big wheels (90mm+) are preferable.

We start at Gasworks Park, at the playground near the towers at 12PM and we are back to Gasworks around 1:30PM to start again around 2PM - and start hard like we do this on Saturdays.

For those who are late at the start - you can keep up with us or just wait for the second start at Gasworks.

See you fresh and ready for the adventure!
