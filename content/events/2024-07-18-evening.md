Explore the beauty of the Puget Sound at sunset and everything the Seattle waterfront has to offer!

This route heads up the waterfront, stopping over at some of our favorite piers for views over the Sound and practicing slides and wizard flow. We'll visit the Olympic Sculpture Park and twist through the waterfront trail until the Expedia parking garage for an hour of flatland socializing and slides. From there, we'll retrace our steps and return to the piers for sunset before finishing at Lumen.
