Join us for a relaxing and social skate on the scenic trail around Green Lake! This is a "choose your own adventure" skate where you can complete as many or as few 3-mile laps as you'd like, with a total distance of up to 12 miles. The path is a paved trail, perfect for a smooth and enjoyable ride.

We'll start and end at the Green Lake Arch, where someone will keep an eye on our belongings. After the skate, we'll unwind with a picnic, so be sure to bring your own blanket, snacks, and any fun picnic activities you enjoy. We might even make a stop for ice cream during our skate! This is a great opportunity to enjoy a beautiful Seattle landmark, get some laps in, and socialize with fellow skaters in a laid-back setting.

**Food & drink options nearby or during the route:**

This is a BYO (Bring Your Own) picnic event, so please bring your own snacks and drinks. There are several takeout restaurants close by along the route.
