Meet at KOMO Plaza by the KOMO Plaza sign. 

This team game is designed for all skill levels. You will use teamwork to discover points of interest in Seattle within the set timeframe, competing for prizes!

We'll spend about 2 hours playing the game, including time for rest, breaks, and snacks as you desire. 

Teams will be assigned. We'll finish at KOMO Plaza and then regroup for the rest of our [Seattle Center urban skate](/events/2024-07-20-morning)!
