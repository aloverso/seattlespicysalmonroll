This is an impromptu route carrying experienced city skaters though some of the best hills, views, nooks, and back alleys of Seattle’s downtown core and South Lake Union.

**Food & drink options nearby or during the route:**

Beforehand, the route starts near Seattle’s International district (5-minute skate, 15-minute walk) with many take out and quick options. The starting point is also close to street vendors who sell hot dogs and other street food on game days.
