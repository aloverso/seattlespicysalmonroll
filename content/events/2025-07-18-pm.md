Starting at Lumen, a mostly chill skate to Alki Beach. Will have some rough pavement and mild hills.
There will be an option for a **Spicy Offshoot** where a group of skaters will branch off to hit a spicy
hill bomb, and the remaining group will take the chiller trail option. The groups will reconnect at
Alki Beach for the evening event.
