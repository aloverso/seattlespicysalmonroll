Starting at Lumen, a mostly chill skate to Alki Beach. Will have some rough pavement and mild hills. All skaters will require some hill control for the West Seattle Bridge.

There will be an option for a **Spicy Offshoot** where a group of skaters will branch off to hit a spicy
hill bomb, and the remaining group will take the chiller trail option. The groups will reconnect at
Alki Beach for the evening event.

**Spicy Offshoot Details:**

This is the Red-hot Admiral Break-off! Spice rating 4.

The spicy route to the Alki beach party will take skaters up and over Admiral hill. The "up" is a sustained uphill that takes skaters between 10-to-20 minutes to climb (wanna race to the top?!) and then we will glide down a beautiful sustained downhill with incredible peekaboo views of Puget Sound below us. There is some rough pavement and excellent hill control is needed due to the length of the hill. Full protection gear recommended.
