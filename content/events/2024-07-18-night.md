_This skate route is TBD and will be a fast city skate finishing near Westlake, University Way, or International District light rail stations_

This route heads up the waterfront to Pike Place, and then cuts across downtown into Westlake and Denny Triangle, likely heading into Capitol Hill to... (get this)... bomb some hill.

<!--
**Route Details:**
