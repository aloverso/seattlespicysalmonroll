*This skate route is TBD and will be a fast city skate finishing near Westlake, University Way, or International District light rail stations*

This route heads up the waterfront to Pike Place, and then cuts across downtown into Westlake and Denny Triangle, likely heading into Capitol Hill to... (get this)... bomb some hill.

<!--
**Route Details:**
- Start at Lumen Field

- Up Garage to Western Avenue
- Western to Pike Place
- Head towards Westlake - pike? Pine?
