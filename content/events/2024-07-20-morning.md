We'll start downtown and head up to Seattle Center. We'll roll through the Bite of Seattle food festival, giving ample time for folks taste a bit of Seattle festival offerings under the canopy of the Space Needle.

We'll spend about 2 hours playing a skate game here! The mysterious and thrilling [Duck Hunt](/events/2024-07-20-afternoon)!
