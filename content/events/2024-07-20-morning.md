We'll start downtown and head up to Seattle Center. We'll roll through the Bite of Seattle food festival under the canopy of the Space Needle.

We'll spend about 2 hours playing a skate game here! The mysterious and thrilling **Duck Hunt**!

After the game, we meet back at EMP metal "Grass" sculpture roundabout (Harrison Avenue) at 3:30 PM , with rollout at 4:00 PM towards Shop Task.

After Shop Task, we'll head along Westlake bike path to the Fremont Bridge, down the Burke-Gilman trail, and finish at Gasworks.

**Finish at:** Gasworks Main Building
