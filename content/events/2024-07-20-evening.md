We'll start at Gas Works and take the Burke-Gilman bike trail across Fremont and Ballard neighborhoods to Golden Garden beach.

Along this route, look forward to opportunities to stop for a flatlands session in Fremont, visiting the Ballard Troll, and slides and hangouts at the marina and at Golden Gardens.

We'll take the same route to return.
