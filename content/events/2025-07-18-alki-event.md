Beach party at Alki!

This will be an evening gathering of skaters from across the Seattle community! Besides the hosts of this event (the Seattle Distance Skating Club), we'll be joined by skaters repping Seattle Weekly Skate Session Of Friendship, Emerald City Skaties, Seattle Skates, and more!

Options for chill beach boardwalk skating, hanging out, food and drinks, music, aggressive rail skating, and more! BYOB or grab food on the waterfront, and expect a fun skater hangout time!

For transport back to Seattle downtown later in the evening, there are several options: rideshare (Uber/Lyft), regularly running buses, carpool with other skaters, or skating back. Some event members will be skating back and can host an informal group along the route — details to come!

**Food & drink options nearby or during:**

Blue Moon burgers, Pepperwood, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Future Primitive brewing, and many other options available on the beach.
