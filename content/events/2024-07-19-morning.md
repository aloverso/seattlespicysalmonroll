From the beginning of time, Tuesday Nights Skate was the quintessence of relaxed & newbie friendly skating.

This week TNS will be different - we will have three sections, significant mileage and some nice hills.

We start skating at 6:30PM sharp from our spot above the Triangle Garage.

We don't wait for those who are rolling late - but they can always catch up.

We skate 520 bridge together - first waiting/resting stop is right after the bridge. The second one is in Bellevue on the parking lot, after which we turn left around the Lake and skate through Bellevue and Kirkland along Market St. to Burke Gilman trail. Before we hit the trail, we will have a couple of waiting stops.

Once we are on the trail, the next stop is Triangle Garage - every skater follows preferred pace.
For this skate the required minimum average speed is 8 mph. After 520 part we don't wait for those who prefer to skate at a more relaxed pace.

The whole circle is 26 miles.

Those who don't want to skate the entire route, can use the bus back or just skate back on 520. This skate is a great opportunity for beginners and intermediate skaters to challenge themselves.
Please don't forget to prepare for the skate, especially if you plan to do a loop.

See you at the starting spot.
