Start from a University of Washington and head downtown, eventually making our way to Alki Beach to prep for the afternoon's chill skate and the evening bonfire.

This route carves through the University, heads along the Burke-Gilman bike trail to Gasworks Park, crosses the Fremont Bridge, and hits a delightful hill on the way to a stopover at Shop Task. From there, we visit South Lake Union past the Amazon balls, to hill-bomb Second Ave on the way to Pioneer Square.
