Skate Alki Beach, Seattle's classic beach trail skate! With beautiful views and flat, smooth pavement, this is every skater's dream.

We’ve planned the Alki beach afternoon evening as a relaxed one-spice skate event. Once we arrive from the previous skate, we'll have a few hours to go off on our own and get food and rest before the planned activities start at 6:00 PM. [Our meeting spot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fx293QkXAx9eBgKD6) is a great spot to chill in the sand and take in the views. Feel free to participate in the planned events... or just chill!

Alki has restaurants, snack shops, ice cream, and a brewery. Most, if not all of these businesses have been very kind to skaters. Blue Moon burgers, Marination Station, Natalie’s, and Future Primitive have all been really accommodating. We kindly ask that you are as respectful as possible when interacting with them so that we can maintain our good relationship. Thank you and enjoy a lovely afternoon on Alki!
