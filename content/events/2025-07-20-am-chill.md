This chill, flat trail skate offers a cruisy and breezy end to a perfect weekend. Starting from Shop Task, you'll glide up the West side of Lake Union, with the option to stop and enjoy the lake and views. For those seeking more, continue up the East side to peek at beautiful Seattle views through mini parks, turning around at Roanoke Street mini park to return to Shop Task for a total of 6 miles.

While generally flat, be aware of a very small slope and some chunky, crappy pavement on the East side. This skate is perfect for those looking to enjoy the lake, look at sailboats, and take in the Seattle scenery before the closing party at Shop Task.

**Food& drink options nearby or during the route:**

Tacos Chukis, Stone Korean, SLU BRU, Flatstick Pub, Tapster, food trucks on Boren Ave between Mercer and Republican
