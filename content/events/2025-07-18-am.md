We'll start at University of Washington, trail skate to Gas Works Park, and then switch
to medium-spice urban skating including a mild hill. We'll visit downtown Seattle including the Amazon
campus, and hit an intermediate hill down 2nd Avenue.

This skate will end at Lumen Stadium to prepare for the evening Alki skate. There will be built-in
time dedicated for stopping for food.
