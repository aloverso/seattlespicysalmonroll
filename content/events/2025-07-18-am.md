We'll start at University of Washington, trail skate to Gas Works Park, and then switch
to medium-spice urban skating including a mild hill. We'll visit [Shop Task](https://usa.shop-task.com/), downtown Seattle including the Amazon
campus, and hit an intermediate hill down 2nd Avenue.

This skate will end at Lumen Stadium to prepare for the evening Alki skate. There will be built-in
time dedicated for stopping for food.

**Food & drink options nearby or during the route:**

Lots of coffee options around the university before the route, coffee shop near shop task, and we'll stop along the route for snacks around lunchtime.
