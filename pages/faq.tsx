                intermediate/advanced level and explore more difficult, hilly, or diverse terrain.

                Each skate will be rated on a <b>1-5 {SPICE} spice scale</b> for skaters to assess
                against their own skill level and what they can expect from each route. In general,
                skaters should be able to stride, turn, and perform at least one basic stop. All
                skates will have regular rest stops to regroup, refuel, hydrate, and recover.
                Additionally, each skate will have a leader to ensure no one gets left behind or
                lost on the route.

                <p>
                  We ask that all skaters use protective equipment: helmets, elbow pads, kneepads,
                  and wrist guards. Additionally, for nighttime skates, you need to bring a form of
                  light - the more the better. Headlamps, blinking lights, reflective clothing or
                  accessories are highly encouraged for post-sunset skates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For every skate, skaters should assess the weather and dress appropriately.
                  Seattle can get hot in the summer! Bring adequate water and food on each skate.

                  <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.91.025">Legally</a>:
                  &quot;[Unlawful transit conduct:] Skates on roller skates or in-line skates, or
                  rides in or upon or by any means a coaster, skateboard, toy vehicle, or any
                  similar device. However, a person may walk while wearing skates or carry a
                  skateboard while on or in a transit vehicle or in or at a transit station if that
                  conduct is not otherwise prohibited by law.&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                  In summary: if you are very careful to &quot;walk&quot; and not &quot;skate&quot;
                  then it is legal to wear skates on King County metro, including buses and the
                  light rail; otherwise you may be subject to a fine. We cannot endorse any
                  particular behavior, you may choose behavior at your own risk.
