              <p>
                Take 6-12 fresh wheels (round, spacers included), stuffed with 12-24 bearings dipped
                in dino juice. You can also use LEDs (Light Emitting Dish) for extra spice. Put all
                of it into the frame and attach to your boot of choice. Wrap in seaweed.
              </p>

              <p>
                Take one helmet and a medley of pads wrapped around an adventurous individual…ready
                for a steaming four days of skating events in the Evergreen Kingdom. A tasty
                destination, with its unique and challenging landscapes, majestic views, paired with
                unforgettable routes through city and trails.
              </p>

                On this bed of land, full of wizards and mystery, an amazing dish - with a spicy
                scale including all levels of urban skaters - is being meticulously prepared.
